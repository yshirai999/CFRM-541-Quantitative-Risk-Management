    "- The inspiration for this problem and the data itself is from Prof. Haugh's Quantitative Risk Management course (IEOR E4602) taught at Columbia University in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider the options data in the OptionsPivotTables.xls Excel workbook.\n",
    "- We want to consider joint stresses of the underlying security price and implied volatility. \n",
    "- In particular, we want to consider shifting the underlying security by -20\\%, -10\\%, -5\\%, 0\\%, +5\\%, +10\\% and +20\\%, and shifting the implied volatility by -5, -2, 0, +2, +5, +10 and +20 volatility points. We therefore have a total of 7 × 7 = 49 scenarios.\n",
