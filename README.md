# Basics codes and examples for Quantitative risk management course

- This course homework rely heavily on those in the Quantitative Risk Management course taught by prof. M. Haugh at Columbia University in the A.Y. 2012-2013.
- I will not post here the solutions to the homework. Students will have access to them on Canvas.
- Some problems are also taken from various examples in McNeill, Frey and Embrecht, *Quantitative Risk Management*, Princeton University Press, 2nd Edition (2015).

## Installation

- The environment.yml file contains all the libraries needed to answer the questions in the homework. To install the environment after cloning the repo, run in the terminal ```conda env create --name CFRM541_QRM s --file=environment.yml```
